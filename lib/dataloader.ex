  # Dataloader

  Dataloader provides an easy way efficiently load data in batches. It's
  inspired by https://github.com/facebook/dataloader, although it makes some
  small API changes to better suit Elixir use cases.

  Central to Dataloader is the idea of a source. A single Dataloader struct can
  have many different sources, which represent different ways to load data.

  Here's an example of a data loader using an ecto source, and then loading some
  organization data.

  ```elixir
  source = Dataloader.Ecto.new(MyApp.Repo)

  # setup the loader
  loader = Dataloader.new |> Dataloader.add_source(:db, source)

  # load some things
  loader =
    loader
    |> Dataloader.load(:db, Organization, 1)
    |> Dataloader.load_many(:db, Organization, [4, 9])

  # actually retrieve them
  loader = Dataloader.run(loader)

  # Now we can get whatever values out we want
  organizations = Dataloader.get_many(loader, :db, Organization, [1,4])
  ```

  This will do a single SQL query to get all organizations by ids 1,4, and 9.
  You can load multiple batches from multiple sources, and then when `run/1` is
  called batch will be loaded concurrently.

  Here we named the source `:db` within our dataloader. More commonly though if
  you're using Phoenix you'll want to name it after one of your contexts, and
  have a different source used for each context. This provides an easy way to
  enforce data access rules within each context. See the `DataLoader.Ecto`
  moduledocs for more details

  # This function should be documented more completely, as it's a core function
  # used by both this module and both predefined sources. Spec should be (I
  # think!):

  # @spec pmap(list(), fun(), keyword()) :: map({any(), any()})
  #
  # Current constraints that I'm questioning in this PR:
  #
  # - `fun` must return a `{key, result}` tuple
  # - If any `fun` errors for whatever reason, nothing gets added to the return
  #   value for that item, effectively swallowing any error
  # - There's not necessarily a relation between the `items` parameter and the
  #   keys in the returned map, so debugging is hard and the code is difficult
  #   to reason about
  #
  # Proposed changes:
  #
  # - Return a map where the keys are the originally passed-in `items`, rather
  #   than letting `fun` define them.
  # - `fun` should return an `:ok`/`:error` tuple with the result of the query.
  #   We have the keys already in `items`, so let's return a map keyed off of
  #   that. The key reason for this is that we now have all the info we need
  #   when accessing the data to either raise or return, rather than losing it
  #   completely.
  #     - NOTE: This isn't perfect yet though because of the reuse between
  #     `Dataloader.run` and `Source.run` implementations. The former has no
  #     concept of "keys" because it's just passing in sources  and assuming
  #     they come out the same way at the other end, whereas the other one has
  #     a concept of "keys" backed into it but hidden as part of a tuple in
  #     `items`. This is the main reason I consider this ripe for a refactor...
  # - Document!
  # - Consider renaming and extracting from here
